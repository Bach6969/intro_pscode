# Client Task B #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

1. Initialize the warehouse grid with a defined number of rows and columns.

2. Set the starting position of the customer on the grid (e.g., top-left corner).

3. Set the target position (location that the customer needs to find).

4. While the customer has not reached the target position:
   a. Display the customer's current position.
   
   b. Prompt the customer to enter a direction to move ("north", "south", "east", or "west").
   
   c. Check the customer's input:
      - If the input is "north":
          i. Update the position to move up by 1 row.
      - If the input is "south":
          i. Update the position to move down by 1 row.
      - If the input is "east":
          i. Update the position to move right by 1 column.
      - If the input is "west":
          i. Update the position to move left by 1 column.
      - If the input is invalid, prompt the customer again.

   d. Check if the new position is within the boundaries of the grid:
      - If the new position is within bounds, update the customer's position.
      - If the new position is out of bounds, notify the customer and keep the original position.

5. If the customer's current position matches the target position:
   a. Print "Congratulations! You have reached the target location."

6. End the program.
